getline harl


Our beloved Harl
There is a class Harl with at least the 5 functions required in the subject.
The function complain() executes the other functions using a pointer to them.
Ideally, the student should have implemented a way of matching the different
strings corresponding to the log level to the pointers of the corresponding
member function.
If the implementation is different but the exercise works, you should mark
it as valid. The only thing that is not allowed is using a ugly if/elseif/else.
The student could have chosen to change the message Harl displays or to
display the examples given in the subject, both are valid.
